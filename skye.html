                <p class="agent-biography-text">
                    Hailing from Australia, Skye and her band of beasts trail-blaze the way through hostile territory. With 
                    her creations hampering the enemy, and her power to heal others, the team is strongest and safest by Skye's 
                    side.
                    </p>
                <p class="agent-biography-text">
                    Skye is a Radiant from Eastern Australia, defender of her homeland's flora and fauna. She uses her Radiant 
                    powers to animate wooden figures which she calls her pack. The pack is her company, as she usually works alone.
                    </p>
                <p class="agent-biography-text">While Skye has said that she was not used to working with other people prior to 
                    joining VALORANT, she has quickly shown herself to be a team player through and through, guiding and reminding 
                    her team to move as one unit and work together as they complete their mission. With her affinity to feel and 
                    sense the natural world and everything else around her, Skye is naturally observant, and will quickly note 
                    whenever she senses something unusual with her surroundings.

                <p class="agent-biography-text">
                    KAY/O is a machine of war built for a single purpose: neutralizing radiants. His power to suppress enemy 
                    abilities cripples his opponents' capacity to fight back, securing him and his allies the ultimate edge.
                    </p>
                <p class="agent-biography-text">
                    KAY/O utilizes polarized Radianite to suppress his enemies in combat, disallowing the use of the opponents' 
                    abilities. Using ZERO/POINT, KAY/O is able to throw a knife which sticks in its target and suppresses 
                    those nearby. Additionally, KAY/O can utilize FLASH/DRIVE and FRAG/MENT, both grenade-like projectiles 
                    stored in his arms, as a Flash and a Molly respectively. Lastly, his ultimate ability, NULL/CMD, overloads 
                    his core with polarized radianite energy, causing him to emit large pulses of suppression.
                    </p>
                <p class="agent-biography-text">Though he is a robot, KAY/O is not particularly devoid of human emotion. He came 
                    to Earth as a veteran who has seen the terrible spoils of war, and he fights determined so that a conflict of 
                    similar proportions will not happen ever again. Given his affiliation in the Human-Radiant War, he has shown 
                    to be more amiable towards his human teammates, while being wary around radiant allies.
